# html-css-website

My personal website that I have worked on and off with for almost two years. Any time I learn something new I can implement it into this website. It will hopefully soon be 
live and used as a kind of portfolio or resume that I will use to log projects that I work on and experiences I have. This repository will be updated as changes happen however 
this is not my source code folder so I will need to push updates at every milestone.
